# BankManagment
This my code for a bank managment system in c++

This a project that started small and i saw the idea from the internet then i tried to add features that i tought it's cool to have
At first i tought that making a as close to reality will be the best. I came to the realisation that it will take a long time to see the results for some stuff
I recommend that instead of using a structure, a class is the best choice because of the encuplsulation the security. i couldn't include it since i just was already more than half way.
This programe is not the best version! There's a lot of stuff to improve...
 
So this is the list of the features i tought of, and i tried to include...

Features (v -> added / x -> not included) :
- save info(accounts and all info,tranfers history, other info) offline -> v
